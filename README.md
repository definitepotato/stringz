# Zig String (A UTF-8 String Library)

[![CI](https://github.com/JakubSzark/zig-string/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JakubSzark/zig-string/actions/workflows/main.yml) ![Github Repo Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/JakubSzark/zig-string?style=flat) ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/JakubSzark/zig-string?style=social)

This library is a UTF-8 compatible **string** library for the **Zig** programming language.
I made this for the sole purpose to further my experience and understanding of zig.
Also it may be useful for some people who need it (including myself), with future projects. Project is also open for people to add to and improve. Please check the **issues** to view requested features.

# Basic Usage

## Managed String

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const String = @import("./zig-string.zig").String;
// ...

// Use your favorite allocator
var arena = std.heap.ArenaAllocator.init(std.heap.page_allocator);
defer arena.deinit();

// Create your String
var myString = String.init(arena.allocator());
defer myString.deinit();

// Use functions provided
try myString.concat("ðŸ”¥ Hello!");
_ = myString.pop();
try myString.concat(", World ðŸ”¥");

// Success!
std.debug.assert(myString.cmp("ðŸ”¥ Hello, World ðŸ”¥"));

```

## Unmanaged String

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const StringUnmanaged = @import("./zig-string.zig").StringUnmanaged;
// ...

// Use your favorite allocator
var arena = std.heap.ArenaAllocator.init(std.heap.page_allocator);
defer arena.deinit();

// Create your String
var myString = String.init();
defer myString.deinit(arena.allocator());

// Use functions provided
try myString.concat(arena, "ðŸ”¥ Hello!");
_ = myString.pop();
try myString.concat(arena, ", World ðŸ”¥");

// Success!
std.debug.assert(myString.cmp("ðŸ”¥ Hello, World ðŸ”¥"));

```

## When To Use Which?

If simplicity is what you want and you don't need granular control over memory, then use `String` (this is fine for most cases). Otherwise you probably want `StringUnmanaged`.

| Feature                         | String | StringUnmanaged            |
| ------------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------- |
| Needs Allocator At Init?        | Yes    | No                         |
| Handles Allocations             | Yes    | No                         |
| Easier To Use?                  | Yes    | Requires memory management |
| Flexible For Custom Allocators? | No     | Yes                        |

# Installation

Add this to your build.zig.zon

```zig
.dependencies = .{
    .string = .{
        .url = "https://github.com/JakubSzark/zig-string/archive/refs/heads/master.tar.gz",
        //the correct hash will be suggested by zig
    }
}

```

And add this to you build.zig

```zig
    const string = b.dependency("string", .{
        .target = target,
        .optimize = optimize,
    });
    exe.root_module.addImport("string", string.module("string"));

```

You can then import the library into your code like this

```zig
const String = @import("string").String;
const StringUnmanaged = @import("string").StringUnmanaged;
```
